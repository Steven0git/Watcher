# File Watcher with Console Clearing

This Node.js script utilizes the `chokidar` library to watch for file and directory changes in a specified directory. Additionally, it includes a feature to clear the console after a specific duration.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your local Node.js project.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up the environment variables (if needed) for the script to watch a specific directory.

## Usage

### Environment Variables

- `TARGET`: Set this variable to specify the directory path you want to watch. If not provided, the current working directory will be used.

### Running the Script

1. Ensure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using `node index.js` or `npm start`.

### Functionality

- The script initializes a file watcher using `chokidar` to monitor file and directory changes in the specified directory.
- Various events like file addition, deletion, modification, and directory addition/deletion are logged to the console.
- After 10 seconds, the console is cleared using platform-specific commands (`cls` for Windows, `clear` for Unix-based systems).

## Code Structure

- `startWatcher()`: Function to initialize the file watcher and set up event listeners.
- `clearConsole()`: Function to clear the console after a specified duration.
- The code is structured to enhance readability, maintainability, and ease of understanding.

## Dependencies

- [chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar): Used for file watching capabilities.
- [child_process](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html): Node.js core module used for executing console-clearing commands.

## Notes

- Ensure proper permissions are set to execute console-clearing commands if running on Unix-based systems.
